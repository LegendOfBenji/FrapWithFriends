# TODO 10/04/19

# Amazon Web Service (1 hour setup dont mess up or else you have to start over)
# Work on events (CRUD)

# url_for(@event.)

# When debugging a rollback go into rails console try the command that you think is breaking the code and append .errors.full_messages

# CONDITIONAL RENDERING (Alex sent a message)

# y u struggle?

# heroku bugs: IF REPLACING A FILE, must name it exactly the same name or else the way git tracks the file and the way heroku tracks the file will clash
# AKA splash1.png committed to git, replace the file with Splash1.png (a different photo) and then commit again, will cause clash with heroku
# Git doesnâ€™t count changing file casing as a change

# Keep separate terminal open while opening heroku to see live logs rather than looking at logs afterwards
